LimboDNS
======

LimboDNS is a nice and simple authoritative Domain Name Server allowing you to run your very own DynDNS service with your domain. Features:

* No complicated installation required. Simply download and run the one-file-server-software.
* Webserver with WebUI included for easy configuration and dynamic DNS updates via HTTP call.
* I know you're tired of messing around with zone files, zone transfers, bind and crazy scripts just to run a simple DynDNS for some devices in your home network.
* Support for IPv4 and IPv6.
* Linux, Windows and other OS capable of running java.
